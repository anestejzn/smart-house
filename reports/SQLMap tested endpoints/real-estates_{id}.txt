[19:35:55] [INFO] testing if the target URL content is stable
[19:35:55] [WARNING] target URL content is not stable (i.e. content differs). sqlmap will base the page comparison on a sequence matcher. If no dynamic nor injectable parameters are detected, or in case of junk results, refer to user's manual paragraph 'Page comparison'
how do you want to proceed? [(C)ontinue/(s)tring/(r)egex/(q)uit] C
other non-custom parameters found. Do you want to process them too? [Y/n/q] Y
